Homework 5 - Plotting with Pyplot and Seaborn
This project performs an exploratory data analysis using python libraries including numpy, matplotlib, scipy, and seaborn. Data on lab tests for drug regimens was analyzed primarily focused on tumor size reduction. Of the drug regimens analyzed, two were identified as demostrated consistent efficacy with low variability. One of these drugs, Capomulin, was further analyzed with a time series plot for one of the subject mice and a scatter plot showing the correlation between mouse weight and tumor volume.
